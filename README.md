## Five Things I've Learned in Engineering

The thickness of acrylic sheets is 3.18 mm

For the Solidworks Exams do the assemblies first

Make multiple prototypes before working on the final product

Design everything in Solidworks to make sure it works the way planned before actually constucting it

Wire everything on a breadboard, attached to the computer, to make sure it actually works before wiring it in the project, because then it is harder to test and make changes

## Hello Raspberry Pi Zero
### Lessons Learned
For this assignment, we first set up and plugged in our Raspberry Pi Circuit. This took us a little while, just finding all of the parts and wires and making sure everything was plugged in in the right place. We had a hard time telling apart some of the cables and usbs at first. Once we got everything wired, we began to learn how to code on Terminal. We learned to write a bash script and a loop to display "Hello World" ten times! The main thing we learned from this assignment was the new syntax, since it is very different and much more straight-forward than coding on Arduino.

## Hello Mathematica
### Lessons Learned
In this assignment we learned how to set up and use Wolfram Mathematica on our Rasperry Pi Zero. We learned how to use integers, and to eventually make a moving plot graph animation! We learned to not only produce the graph, but to make it interactive since we could slide little bars to change aspects of the plot. We had a hard time with this, but after plotting the graph, we researched how to turn it into an animation and make it interactive and eventually we were successful!

## Hello Python
### Lessons Learned
For this assignment we learned the python script by writing a loop to print "Hello World" ten times. Then, we learned how to code a program that randomly generated a number between 1 and 6, so essentially a dice roller. It took us a little while to figure this out, but what was hardest for us was getting it to start upon the user's request, and then to stop again when asked.

## Python Program 01 - Calculator
### Lessons Learned
In this assignment, we learned to use Python to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder of two numbers. We asked the program to print the return from our function. The tricky part was figuring out how to use one function for each of the equations.
